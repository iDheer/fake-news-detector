# Testing Methodology

This document outlines the testing strategy and methodology employed for the GenAI-powered NLP system.

## 1. Overview

The primary goal of our testing is to ensure the reliability, correctness, and performance of the system across its various components, from individual modules to the integrated application. We aim to identify and fix bugs early in the development cycle.

## 2. Types of Testing

### 2.1. Unit Testing
- **Objective:** To test individual components (functions, classes, modules) in isolation.
- **Tools:** Pytest
- **Location:** `tests/` directory (e.g., `test_ai_service.py`, `test_news_service.py`).
- **Approach:**
    - Each service and critical utility function has corresponding unit tests.
    - Tests cover normal cases, edge cases, and error handling.
    - Mocks and stubs are used where necessary to isolate units, especially for external API calls or GenAI model interactions during pure unit tests.
    - Assertions verify that the outputs match expectations for given inputs.
- **GenAI Usage:**
    - GenAI tools were used to help generate boilerplate test functions.
    - GenAI assisted in identifying potential edge cases for specific functions.

### 2.2. Integration Testing
- **Objective:** To test the interaction between different components or microservices.
- **Approach:**
    - **Service-Level Integration:** Testing the flow of data and control between services (e.g., how `news_service` interacts with `ai_service`). This is partially covered by some tests in the `tests/` directory that might call actual service methods.
    - **API Endpoint Testing:** Testing the FastAPI endpoints to ensure they correctly process requests and return expected responses. This can be done manually using tools like Postman/Insomnia or with automated scripts.
    - **Frontend-Backend Integration:** Ensuring the Streamlit frontend communicates correctly with the backend APIs/services.
- **GenAI Usage:**
    - GenAI was consulted for strategies on how to structure integration tests for a microservices-style application.

### 2.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- **Objective:** To test the entire application flow from the user's perspective.
- **Approach:**
    - Simulating user scenarios, starting from input in the frontend (Streamlit or CLI) through all backend processing, including GenAI interactions, and data storage/retrieval, to the final output displayed to the user.
    - Manual E2E testing was performed by interacting with the Streamlit application and verifying the results against expected outcomes.
- **GenAI Usage:**
    - GenAI helped brainstorm potential user scenarios and E2E test cases.

### 2.4. GenAI Model Output Testing (Prompt Testing)
- **Objective:** To evaluate and refine the quality, relevance, and accuracy of outputs from the GenAI models used by the system.
- **Approach:**
    - Iteratively testing different prompts with the GenAI models.
    - Evaluating responses based on predefined criteria (e.g., coherence, factuality, adherence to style).
    - Documenting effective prompts in `docs/genai_prompts.md`.
    - Comparing outputs from different models or prompt variations.
- **GenAI Usage:**
    - GenAI itself was used to critique its own outputs or suggest improvements to prompts.

## 3. Test Execution and Reporting
- **Unit Tests:** Executed using `pytest` from the command line.
- **Manual Tests:** Documented informally, with issues tracked via GitHub issues or a similar mechanism.
- **CI/CD:** (If implemented, e.g., GitHub Actions) Unit tests can be configured to run automatically on each push or pull request.

## 4. Testing Environment
- **Local Development:** Most tests are run on local development machines.
- **Staging/Cloud:** (If applicable) Key tests should be re-run in the deployed environment to catch environment-specific issues.

## 5. Challenges and Limitations
- **Testing GenAI Outputs:** The non-deterministic nature of some GenAI outputs can make automated testing challenging. Focus is on patterns, presence of key information, or using another GenAI to evaluate responses.
- **Resource Constraints:** Limited time and resources may restrict the comprehensiveness of automated E2E tests.
- **Dependency on External Services:** Tests involving external APIs (news sources, GenAI models) require careful management (e.g., using mocks, handling rate limits).

## 6. Future Improvements
- Implement more automated integration and E2E tests.
- Develop a more formal process for evaluating GenAI model outputs.
- Integrate automated testing into a CI/CD pipeline.
